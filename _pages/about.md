About me
======
I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in [Statistics](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/biostat.aspx) at University of Rochester. My advisor is Prof. [Brent A. Johnson](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/biostat/people/faculty/johnson.aspx) and [Ashkan Ertefaie](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/biostat/people/faculty/ertefaie.aspx).
My research interests lie in time-to-event data, semiparametric theory, and causal inference.

Prior to joining University of Rochester, I received my B.S. degree of Statistics in Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, China.
